Bitfinex_lwt is a module of lwt friendly bindings to the Bitfinex REST API.
It is setup as a functor that will take a module of Bitfinex user account information.

It has the following dependencies:
Lwt
Lwt.syntax
Yojson
Cohttp
hex
nocrypto

Generate all of the Bitfinex API bindings for from user account information as follows:

module MyAccountInfo : AccountInfo =
  struct
    let public_key = "api_public_key_goes_here"
    let private_key = "api_private_key_goes_here"
  end

module BitfinexAPI = Make (MyAccountInfo)

Then all of the Bitfinex API functions can be called from the BitfinexAPI module.
